Administrators
As an authenticated Administrator, I can:
Create item listings including a name, description, price, and upload a photo
Modify existing items’ name, description, price, and photo
Create named categories for items (eg: "Small Plates")
Assign items to categories or remove them from categories. Products can belong to more than one category.
Retire a item from being sold, which hides it from browsing by any non-administrator
As an Administrator, I can also view an order "dashboard" where I can:
See a listing of all orders with:
the total number of orders by status
links for each individual order
filter orders to display by status type (for statuses "ordered", "paid", "cancelled", "completed")
link to transition to a different status:
link to "cancel" individual orders which are currently "ordered" or "paid"
link to "mark as paid" orders which are "ordered"
link to "mark as completed" individual orders which are currently "paid"
Access details of an individual order, including:
Order date and time
Purchaser full name and email address
For each item on the order:
Name linked to the item page
Quantity
Price
Line item subtotal
Total for the order
Status of the order


NOT allowed to:
Modify any personal data aside from their own
Data Validity
There are several types of entities in the system, each with certain required data. Any attempt to create or modify a record with invalid attributes should return the user to the input form with a validation error indicating the problem along with suggestions how to fix it.
Item
An item must have a title, description, and price.
An item must belong to at least one category.
The title and description cannot be empty strings.
The title must be unique for all items in the system.
The price must be a valid decimal numeric value and greater than zero.
The photo is optional. If not present, a stand-in photo is used.
User
A user must have a plausibly valid email address that is unique across all users
A user must have a full name that is not blank
A user may optionally provide a display name that must be no less than 2 characters long and no more than 32
Order
An order must belong to a user
An order must be for one or more items currently being sold
